# Trellis Deploy GitHub Action

*This is a fork of [Trellis Deploy](https://github.com/steenbergen-design/trellis-action) by [Steenbergen Design](https://steenbergen.design). This repository is a maintenance fork maintained by [Thomas Georgel](https://github.com/tgeorgel). It also support more feature, such as support for multiple node versions.*

This action deploys your bedrock site to your trellis environment.
This action will symlink site_local to their right place as defined in `wordpress_sites.yml`, so you're also covered when trellis and your bedrock setup are not in the same repo.

## Requirements

- [Trellis](https://github.com/roots/trellis) (pyhton 3 compatable)
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- (Optional) Bedrock
- (Optional) Sage [9.0.1](https://github.com/roots/sage/releases/tag/9.0.1) (node 10 compatible) or later

## Versions

| Version | Ansible Version | Node Version supported |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| 1.4.1   | 2.18            | 18, 20, 22 |
| 1.3.0   | 2.18            | 18 |
| 1.2.0   | 2.18            | 20 |
| 1.1.x   | 2.13            | 20 |

## `with` args

Check [`action.yml`](./action.yml) inputs for all `with` args available. You can also define `env` vars to use with ansible.

## File Structures

[Trellis Deploy](https://github.com/tgeorgel/trellis-action) with 2 different `main.yml` examples. They are expecting different Trellis and Bedrock structures.

### Official

Use [`main.yml`](./main.yml) if your directory structure follow [the official documents](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/installing-trellis/#create-a-project):

```plain
example.com/      # → Root folder for the project
├── .git/         # → Only one git repo
├── trellis/      # → Your clone of roots/trellis, directory name must be `trellis`
└── site/         # → A Bedrock-based WordPress site, directory name doesn't matter
```

To install `main.yml`:

1. Set up SSH keys, Ansible Vault password and commit Trellis changes described in the following sections
1. In your repository, go to the _Settings > Secrets_ menu and create a new secret called `vault_pass`. Put the vault pass into the contents field.
1. In your workflow definition file, add `tgeorgel/trellis-action@v1.4.1`. See next example:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/main.yml
jobs:
  my_job:
  ...
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.5.4
        with:
          ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          ssh-auth-sock: ${{ github.workspace }}/ssh-auth.sock

      - uses: tgeorgel/trellis-action@v1.4.1
        with:
          vault_password: ${{ secrets.VAULT_PASS }}
          vault_password_file: .vault_pass # option, if you uses a different vault password file name
          site_env: production
          site_name: example.com
          node_version: 20
```

### Seperated repo's

Some use a opinionated project structure:

- separate Trellis and Bedrock as 2 different git repo
- name the Bedrock-based WordPress site directory more creatively, i.e: `bedrock`

```plain
example.com/      # → Root folder for the project
├── bedrock/      # → A Bedrock-based WordPress site, directory name doesn't matter
│   └── .git/     # Bedrock git repo
└── trellis/      # → Clone of roots/trellis, directory name must be `trellis`
    └── .git/     # Trellis git repo
```

See: [roots/trellis#883 (comment)](https://github.com/roots/trellis/issues/883#issuecomment-329052189)

1. Set up SSH keys, Ansible Vault password and commit Trellis changes described in the following sections
2. In your repository, go to the _Settings > Secrets_ menu and create a new secret called `vault_pass`. Put the vault pass into the contents field.
3. In your workflow definition file, add `tgeorgel/trellis-action@v1.4.1` and another checkout action for your trellis repo. See next example. The trellis action will move the site to its right directory, so there's no additional setup required.

```diff
    ...
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1

+   - uses: actions/checkout@v1
+     with:
+       repository: roots/trellis
+       ref: master
+       token: ${{ secrets.GIT_PAT }} # Your GitHub access token
+       path: repo-name/trellis
+       fetch-depth: 1

    - uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.1.1
      with:
          ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          ssh-auth-sock: ${{ github.workspace }}/ssh-auth.sock
    ...
```

## SSH Key

This is only aplicable if using one of the example codes above. This action has no option to set a SSH key.

In order to create a new SSH key, run `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m pem -f path/to/keyfile`. This will prompt you for a key passphrase and save the key in `path/to/keyfile`.

Having a passphrase is a good thing, since it will keep the key encrypted on your disk. When configuring the secret `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` value in your repository, however, you will need the private key _unencrypted_.

To show the private key unencrypted, run `openssl rsa -in path/to/key -outform pem`.

### Authorizing a key

To actually grant the SSH key access, you can – on GitHub – use at least two ways:

* [Deploy keys](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys) can be added to individual GitHub repositories. They can give read and/or write access to the particular repository. When pulling a lot of dependencies, however, you'll end up adding the key in many places. Rotating the key probably becomes difficult.

* A [machine user](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#machine-users) can be used for more fine-grained permissions management and have access to multiple repositories with just one instance of the key being registered. It will, however, count against your number of users on paid GitHub plans.

### Trellis

1. Add the SSH key to web server

    ```diff
        # group_vars/<env>/users.yml
        users:
        - name: "{{ web_user }}"
            groups:
            - "{{ web_group }}"
            keys:
            - https://github.com/human.keys
    +       - https://github.com/mybot.keys
        - name: "{{ admin_user }}"
            groups:
            - sudo
            keys:
            - https://github.com/human.keys
    ```

2. Re-provision: `$ ansible-playbook server.yml -e env=<env> --tags users`

## Ensure Trellis Deploys the Correct Commit

Normally, Trellis always deploy the **latest** commit of the branch. We need a change in `group_vars/<env>/wordpress_sites.yml`:

```diff
 # group_vars/<env>/wordpress_sites.yml
 wordpress_sites:
   example.com:
-    branch: master
+    branch: "{{ site_version | default('master') }}"
```

## Ansible Vault Password

Unlike other environment variables, [Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_vault.html) password should never be stored as plaintext. Therefore, you should add `vault_pass` via your project settings instead of commit it to `.github/workflow/main.yml`.

The examples assume you have defined `vault_password_file = .vault_pass` in `ansible.cfg` as [the official document](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/vault/#2-inform-ansible-of-vault-password) suggested.

```diff
 # ansible.cfg
 [defaults]
+vault_password_file = .vault_pass
```

To use another vault password filename:

```diff
        - uses: tgeorgel/trellis-action@v1.4.1
          with:
            vault_password: ${{ secrets.vault_pass }}
+           vault_password_file: myvaultfile.txt
            site_env: production
            site_name: example.com
```

Using [Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_vault.html) to encrypt sensitive data is strongly recommended. In case you have a very strong reason not to use Ansible Vault, remove the var:

```diff
        - uses: tgeorgel/trellis-action@v1.4.1
          with:
-           vault_password: ${{ secrets.vault_pass }}
            site_env: production
            site_name: example.com
```

## Mutliple sites at once

You can also choose to deploy multiple sites at once by searching for `site_key == site_value`.
If someone has a more elegant solution. Please PR!

```diff
        - uses: tgeorgel/trellis-action@v1.4.1
          with:
            vault_password: ${{ secrets.vault_pass }}
            site_env: production
-           site_name: example.com
+           site_key: repo
+           site_value: git@github.com:${{ github.repository }}
```

## Known issues, limitations and FAQ

### NodeJS version

We’re using the `willhallonline/ansible:2.13-alpine-3.16` docker image, so NodeJS 16 is available.

### Python 3

We're using python 3, make sure your trellis is up to date.

## Hacking

As a note to my future self, in order to work on this repo:

* Clone it
* Run `yarn install` to fetch dependencies
* _hack hack hack_
* `node index.js` (inputs are passed through `INPUT_` env vars)
* Read [Creating a JavaScript action](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-javascript-action) if unsure.
